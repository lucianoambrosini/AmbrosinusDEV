**Win SD launcher** is a *Windows OS App (.EXE)* that simplifies the launching task of the AUTOMATIC1111 project locally, a wonderful project allows users to run Stable Diffusion and ControlNET locally on their machines. **WinSDlauncher** makes launching the application quicker and easier (as I said it is only for "lazy" designers I use it a lot üòâ)

### Info components
This tool allows you to set (only once from the first start) the path of the folder where you installed Stable Diffusion (and related expansions such as ControlNET) on your machine. *With v1.1.1 is not required to run the App as a Windows Administrator, simply install your Stable Diffusion from AUTOMATIC1111 in a folder easily accessible¬†- for instance, I have installed it on my Desktop.*
