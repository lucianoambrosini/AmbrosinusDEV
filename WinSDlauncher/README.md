**Win SD launcher** is a *Windows OS App (.EXE)* that simplifies the launching task of the AUTOMATIC1111 project locally, a wonderful project allows users to run Stable Diffusion and ControlNET locally on their machines. **WinSDlauncher** makes launching the application quicker and easier (as I said it is only for "lazy" designers I use it a lot üòâ)

### Info components
This tool allows you to set (only once from the first start) the path of the folder where you installed Stable Diffusion (and related expansions such as ControlNET) on your machine. *Since v1.1.1 is not required to run the App as a Windows Administrator, simply install your Stable Diffusion from AUTOMATIC1111 in a folder easily accessible¬†- for instance, I have installed it on my Desktop.* From tab "Settings" is now possible set all the **"webui-user.bat" command arguments** and overwrite/create this bat file in one click! For this reason the **1 -2 -3 sequence is very important**

## Requirements
After the release of ControlNET v1.1 (but not fully supported by APIs), I decided to realize **two video demos about how to install the AUTOMATIC1111 project with ControlNET v1.0 and v1.1 versions**. The question is twofold, firstly I use Stable Difusion locally to run some Ambrosinus-Toolkit AI components inside Grasshopper (*"AIeng_loc"*, for instance, still uses ControlNET v1.0) and by using WinSDlauncher v1.1.2 I can configure the webui-user.bat file avoiding to load "autolaunch" argument (this is just a straightforward example). Secondly, being also a WebUI user too, I can switch very quickly between my Stable Diffusion local installations (one with ControlNET v1.0 and the other one with v1.0) by simply selecting in the "tab Settings" the proper folder.

**Enjoy your Design exploration!** üòâ

**P.S.:** This is my first APP/Utility for Windows OS but it is functional for its intended purpose.
