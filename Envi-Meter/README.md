**Envi-Meter** is an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) device designed for environmental data collection (data mining), specifically aimed at supporting architectural design and simulations. The project utilizes an ESP32 board and integrates with Blynk.io for effective environmental data mining tasks in architectural contexts.
The Envi-Meter serves as a tool to gather and analyze environmental data, facilitating a deeper understanding of how environmental factors influence architectural design. Ambrosini's work emphasizes the intersection of technology and design, showcasing how data-driven insights can enhance architectural practices (especially his consultancy services).

### Designed for Portability and Efficiency

Envi-Meter comes in a sleek, 3D-printed case housing the core sensors and microcontroller. It‚Äôs powered by an external power bank, making it easily transportable ‚Äì even through airport security. The device operates on a ‚Äúwake and sleep‚Äù cycle, actively collecting data during predetermined daytime hours and entering an energy-saving mode at night.
